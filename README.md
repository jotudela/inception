# 🚀 INTRODUCTION

The `inception` 42 project challenges students to harness the power of containerization to build a fully functional, modular infrastructure.

By leveraging Docker's capabilities, this project focuses on orchestrating multiple containers to create a robust, isolated environment where different services work seamlessly together.

From configuring a secure web server to managing a persistent database, the `inception` project emphasizes precision, security, and efficiency. This journey is not just about mastering the tools, but about understanding the critical architectural decisions that drive modern software deployment.
